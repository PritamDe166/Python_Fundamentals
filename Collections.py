# Types of collections data types in Python:

# 1. List
employee_ages = [23,21,23,34,45, 61, 34, 19, 45, 67, 89, 90, 12, 34, 56, 78, 90, 12, 34, 56, 78, 90]
# employee_ages.sort()          # Sort the list in ascending order
# employee_ages.append(100)     # Add a new age to the list
# employee_ages.remove(12)        # Remove the age we just added
print("Employee Ages:", employee_ages)



# 2. Tuple
coordinates = (10.3, 13.5, 14.1)
print("The location is:", coordinates)
# Tuples are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after creation
